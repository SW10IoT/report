This report engaged in creating a tool for detecting security flaws in Python web applications.
Firstly, the background for the project was examined, including the Python programming language and the Flask web framework.
We then proceeded to manufacture some Flask applications with vulnerabilities.
The resulting applications would then be used to check if the tool was able to detect them.

The theory needed to build such a tool was then described.
The theory includes control flow analysis, the monotone framework and taint analysis.

The tool \pyt{} was then implemented and evaluated.
\pyt{} was able to find all the manufactured vulnerabilities.
It was also able to run on open source Flask projects, but was not able to find any vulnerabilities in these.
