In order to analyse a Flask application it is necessary to have a basic understanding of both the Flask framework and the Python programming language.
In addition we need to have an understanding of the security vulnerabilities that we want to detect.

This chapter will attempt to make an introductory course in Python and flask, first covering the basics and then describing the important constructs that will be used in the report.
Afterwards it will describe the vulnerabilities that our tool is supposed to detect.
