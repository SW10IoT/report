\subsection{Balancing Cost and Precision of Approximate Type Inference in Python}
This section contains and overview of the work of \citet{fritz}.
This master thesis implements a data flow analyses for Python.
\citet{fritz} uses the worklist algorithm to compute the result of an analysis using fixpoint iteration.
The analysis is expressed as a monotone framework.
Widening is used to ensure termination.
He has made an analysis to make a overview of names mapped to what types they have.
The aim of the thesis is to find the most efficient way in both results and time to do this.

The thesis contains brief explanation about the implementation in Appendix A.
Unfortunately the source code is not open source and not available neither is the software.
If the source code would have been available one could have used the control flow graph and the worklist algorithm from this thesis.
