\section{Why Flask}
This section argues why the the Flask web framework was chosen.
The two key factors to why the Flask framework was chosen was its simplicity and our previous experience with the framework.
These factors will be described shortly in the following.

\paragraph{Simplicity}
The simplicity of Flask enables us to focus on the important task at hand and not on how to develop a web applicaiton.
This means rapid development of web applications used as examples and for testing the tool during the project.

\paragraph{Previous experience}
The project group has previous experience using Flask.
This again means that we can develop examples faster, without having to spend time getting aquainted with the framework.
