\section{Why Flask}
This section argues why the the Flask web framework was chosen.
Key factors to why the Flask framework was chosen:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple
\item Previous experience
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Simple}
The simplicity of Flask enables us to focus on the important task at hand and not on how to develop a web applicaiton.
This means rapid development of web applications used as examples and for testing during the project.
\paragraph{Previous experience}
The project group has previous experience using Flask.
This is an important factor as the project is about finding security vulnerabilities so the choice of framework is not that significant.
This means the previous experience helps focusing on the right task.
