\section{Why Flask}
This section argues why the the Flask web framework was chosen.
Flask is a small framework where the developer has a lot of power on how to structure and do things.
The framework is easy to grasp although it can be tough to master.
A factor to take into account is that the project group has previous experience using Flask.
This is an important factor as the project is about finding security vulnerabilities so the choice of framework is not that significant.
Another important factor is the simplicity of Flask.
This simplicity enables us to focus on the important task at hand and not how to develop a web app.
