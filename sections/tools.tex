\section{Existing Tools}
In this section we attempt to look at tools that find security vulnerabilities by analysing Python web applications.
We have found two tools which are described in the following.

\subsection{Python Taint Mode}
The Python Taint Mode, \citet{conti2010taint}, is a 300 LOC library which contains a series of functions that are used as decorators to taint the source code.
To use the library one has to decorate the source code.
Also for variables a function \texttt{taint} is used to taint them.
Using this tool means one has to go through the whole source code and taint, variables and functions.
The tool can not handle booleans and has some built in class function it can not handle.
The effectiveness of the tool is not documented.

\subsection{Rough Auditing Tool for Security}
The Rough Auditing Tool for Security(RATS)
