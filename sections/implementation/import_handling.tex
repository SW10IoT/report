\section{Handling Imports}
This section contains a rationale of how the imports are handled.
The two way of importing files, import and import-from, are presented in \cref{python:import} and these two way need to be handled separately.
They are handled separately in the way that the naming for import is prefixed by the name of the module and this is not the case for import-from.
