\section{Control Flow Graph}
The \texttt{control\_flow\_graph} module contains a class, \texttt{CFG}, that specifies and builds the CFG.
It also contains different classes that specify different nodes used for constructing the CFG.
The \texttt{CFG} class uses the visitor pattern\cite{design_patterns} to visit the nodes in the abstract syntax tree(AST).
