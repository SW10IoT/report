\section{Vulnerabilities}\label{impl:vulnerabilities}
This module uses the result of the fixed-point analysis to detect vulnerabilities in the application.
First it is needed to determine which flows are dangerous.
Then taint analysis can be employed, and the resulting vulnerabilities will be recorded and displayed in a readable manner to the developer.
