\section{Limitations}
This should contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Having no dynamic analysis is a major disadvantage'' - Rene
\item Monkey patching
\item import own module/library module etc. Also as statement

\item Inbuilt/library (?)
\item Others?

\subsection{Language Constructs}
This section contains a list of language constructs that were not implemented due to time constraints and as we did not face them in the projects we ran as input.
Language constructs not implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Async} - used for asynchronous programming.\cite{python_async}
\item \textbf{Decorators} - used for decorators explained in \cref{python:decorators}.
\item \textbf{Try} - used for catching exceptions.\cite{python_exception}
\item \textbf{Delete} - a statement to delete a name.\cite{python_delete}
\item \textbf{Assert} - a statement that can be used to insert debugging assertions into a program.\cite{python_assert}
\item \textbf{Global} - a statement that declares a name global so that one can access global names from other scopes.\cite{python_global}
\item \textbf{Yield} - used in generator functions to ``return'' an item at a time.\cite{python_yield}
\item \textbf{Starred} - used for unpacking.\cite{python_unpacking}
\end{itemize}
