\section{Python Web Frameworks}
This section contains some of the available Python web frameworks.
The web frameworks are chosen from \citet{python_web_frameworks_list}.

\subsection{Django}
Django\cite{django_cite} is a web framework that contains all you need to make a complete web application.
Django is using the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern(MVC)\cite{leff2001web}.
It is build in a way that one has to add stuff in a specific way.
This means that there is not a lot customiseability in how the architecture of the project is built.

Django operates with a abstract concept of apps.
An app contains the following modules:
\begin{itemize}
\item Main module - where the app is starting to execute code.
\item Tests module - testing of the app.
\item Views module - visualisation of the app.
\item Urls module - maps urls to views.
\item Models module - models for instance from a database.
\item Apps module - nested apps.
\end{itemize}
A Django web application consists of a combination of apps.
