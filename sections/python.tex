\section{Python}
This section will shortly give an overview of the Python programming language.
This section is based on \citet{python_docs}.

The Python programming language was created by Guido van Rossum in the early 1990s and is to this day the main author.
As the language has grown there are obviously many more contributors and everyone can contribute as Python is Open Source.
