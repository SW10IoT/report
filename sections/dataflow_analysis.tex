\section{Dataflow analysis}
The type of dataflow analysis that we want to perform is called the \emph{monotone framework}.
The monotone framework utilizes the concepts that have now been introduced.

A CFG of the program is generated to represent the flow of the program.
A lattice with finite height together with a collection of dataflow constraints comprise the analysis to be performed.
Running the fixed-point algorithm on the parts will result in an approximation of the answer to the analysis which can then be interpreted.
