\section{Related Work}
As mentioned in \cref{existing_tools}, few tools exist that do anything like what we want.
The same is the case in terms of research papers.
This section will present the single paper that had a similar goal as our project.

\subsection{Balancing Cost and Precision of Approximate Type Inference in Python}
This section contains and overview of the work of \citet{fritz}.
This master's thesis implements a data flow analysis for performing approximate type inference on Python code.

\citet{fritz} builds a CFG of the source code, and uses the worklist algorithm to compute the result of an analysis using fixpoint iteration.
The result is then used to perform type inference on.

The thesis contains brief explanation about the implementation in Appendix A.
Unfortunately the source code is not available.
If the source code would have been available, the implementation of the control flow graph and the worklist algorithm could have been used as a foundation for our project.
