In order to analyse a Flask application it is necessary to have a basic understanding of both the Flask framework and the Python programming language.
In addition we need to have an understanding of the security vulnerabilities that we want to detect.

This chapter will start out by describing the tools that already exists for finding security vulnerabilities in python web applications.
Afterwards it will make an introductory course in the central technologies Python and Flask, first covering the basics and then describing the important constructs that will be used in the report.
At last, it will describe the vulnerabilities that our tool is supposed to detect.
