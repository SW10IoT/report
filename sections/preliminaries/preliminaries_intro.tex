In order to analyse a Flask application it is necessary to have a basic understanding of both the Flask framework and the Python programming language.
In addition we need to have an understanding of the security vulnerabilities that we want to detect.

This chapter will start out by describing the tools that already exists for finding security vulnerabilities in Python web applications.
Afterwards it will look at related work performed in this area of research.
At last it will examine what web frameworks exist in order to choose one to focus on throughout the project.
