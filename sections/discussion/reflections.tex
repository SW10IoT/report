\section{Reflections}
This chapter will reflect on \pyt{} and the experiences we have had during the development of the tool.

\subsection{Are frameworks like Flask good for web security?}
In the beginning of the project period we had an idea of making a tool that could find security flaws in web applications.
We were well aware that vulnerabilities would not be in an abundance.
Even when looking at lists of well known vulnerabilities, these were hard to apply to Flask applications.
Flask takes care of a lot without the user even having to think about it.

We therefore had to resort to the vulnerabilities we presented in \cref{security_vulnerabilities}.
These vulnerabilities are still dangerous, but could be unlikely to be found in the wild. (Maybe with the exception of the command injection vulnerability. This may actually be valid for some cases.)

Our experience with the Flask framework is therefore an indication that frameworks like Flask definitely help security of web applications.
