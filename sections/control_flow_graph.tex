\section{Control Flow Graph}
If one wants to analyse a program and the analysis is flow sensitive one can use a Control Flow Graph(CFG) to track the flow of the program.
An analysis being flow sensitive means that it does matter in which order pieces of the program are executed.
A CFG is simply just another representation of the program source.
It is a directed graph where a node is a specific place in the program and edges represent the possible options to which the program can execute to.
A CFG always consists of one entry node and one exit node, called \textit{entry} and \textit{exit}.
Given a node \textit{n} the set of predecessor nodes are denoted \textit{pred(n)} and the set of successors are denoted \textit{succ(n)}.

We will now look at the control flow structures in the Python programming language.
A CFG for the different control flows for the if statement can be found in \cref{fig:if}.

The CFG for the different usage of the while statement can be found in \cref{fig:while}
