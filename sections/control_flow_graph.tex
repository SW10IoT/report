\section{Control Flow Graph}\label{control_flow_graph}
If one wants to analyse a program and the analysis is flow sensitive one can use a Control Flow Graph(CFG) to track the flow of the program.
An analysis flow sensitive means that it is significant in which order pieces of the program are executed.
A CFG is simply just another representation of the program source.
It is a directed graph where a node is a specific place in the program and edges represent the possible options to which the program can execute to.
A CFG always consists of one entry node and one exit node, called \textit{entry} and \textit{exit}.
Given a node \textit{n} the set of predecessor nodes are denoted \textit{pred(n)} and the set of successors are denoted \textit{succ(n)}.

\paragraph{Python control flow graphs}
CFGs for simple Python statements, such as an assignment, have an entry node, a node containing the assignment and an exit node.
The CFG of the sequence of two statements $S_1$ and $S_2$ are constructed by deleting the exit node of $S_1$ and the entry node of $S_2$ and \emph{gluing} the two resulting graphs together.
This process is depicted on \cref{cfg_sequence}.

The CFGs of  control flow structures in the Python programming language was presented in the figures provided in \cref{python:control_structures}.

\textbf{Note} that the \textit{else} clause is not represented as a independent node, the false branch is represented in the same way as the true branch in a ``if-else'' structure.

The CFG for a complete program is produced by systematically combining the building blocks.
A CFG of the general example, \cref{theory:general_code_example}, is shown on \cref{theory:general_code_example_cfg}.
