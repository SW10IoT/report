\section{Systems of Equations}\label{theory:fixedpoint:systemsofequations}
Combining equations into a system of equations can be solved by using fixed-points.
Consider an equation system of the form:

$
\begin{array}{l c l}
x_1 = F_1(x_1, \dots, x_n) \\
x_2 = F_2(x_1, \dots, x_n)\\
\vdots\\
x_n = F_n(x_1, \dots, x_n)\\
\end{array}
$

Here $x_i$ are variables and $F_i: L^n \rightarrow L$ is a monotone function.
A least unique solution to such a system can be found as the least fixed-point of the combined function $F : L^n \rightarrow L^n$ defined by:

$F(x_1, \dots, x_n) = (F_1(x_1, \dots, x_n), \dots, F_n(x_1, \dots, x_n)) $
