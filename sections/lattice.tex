\section{Lattice Theory}
  The static analysis we want to perform utilizes the mathematical theory of lattices together with a monotone function to guarantee that the analysis will terminate.

  \paragraph{Partial orders}
  A lattice is a specialization of a partial order which will be described.
  A partial order is a mathematical structure $L = (S, \sqsubseteq)$
