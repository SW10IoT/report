\section{Parameter Passing}\label{python:parameter_passing}
This section describes how Python deals with parameter passing and is inspired by \citet{parameter_passing}, official documentation for this can be found at \citet{parameter_passing_official}.
This section is included as it is important to factor in when parameters are assigned in functions.

The most known parameter passing techniques are pass-by-reference and pass-by-value.
A short description of these two will lead up to an explanation of how Python is handling parameter passing.
Python is basically using pass-by-value but objects are passed by reference, this is the same as for instance in Java and C\#.
To illustrate the different approaches the following two functions are used, \cref{parameter_passing:reassign} and \cref{parameter_passing:append}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=python, caption={Parameter passing: \texttt{reassign} function.}, label={parameter_passing:reassign}]
  def reassign(l):
      l = [1]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=python, caption={Parameter passing: \texttt{append} function.}, label={parameter_passing:append}]
  def append(l):
      l.append(1)
\end{lstlisting}

An abstract way of showing the internal representation will be used.
An example can be seen on \cref{parameter_example} where we have a variable \texttt{l} which points at a list which is an object stored in memory as \texttt{[0]}.
In python a variable is just a name that points to some object in memory.
A name is illustrated as a box.
Assigning 1 to a variable and then reassigning it to 2 does not change the 1 in memory.
It just saves the 2 object in memory and makes the variable point at this object.

\ppv{l}{[0]}{A variable \texttt{l} pointing at a list \texttt{[0]}}{parameter_example}

\paragraph{Pass-by-reference}
Pass-by-reference is a parameter passing mechanism where the argument is directly passed into the function.
Consider passing \texttt{l = [0]} to the function \texttt{reassign}.
After the call the object \texttt{l} is changed to: \texttt{l = [1]}, visualised on \cref{parameter_reference_reassign}.

\ppv{l}{[1]}{The variable \texttt{l} pointing at the list \texttt{[0]} after calling function \texttt{reassign}}{parameter_reference_reassign}

This is because the variable is passed directly which means that the function is operating directly on the object.
The \texttt{append} function behaves similarly, but because append adds to the list the result is: \texttt{l = [0, 1]}, visualised in \cref{parameter_reference_append}.

\ppv{l}{[0, 1]}{The variable \texttt{l} pointing at the list \texttt{[0, 1]} after calling function \texttt{append}}{parameter_reference_append}


\paragraph{Pass-by-value}
The other well known parameter passign mechanism is pass-by-value, where the actual parameter is copied and passed into the function.
The actual parameter is copied and stored a new place in memory and the copy is passed into the function.
Given the object \texttt{l = [0]} passed as parameter to the function \texttt{reassign}, the copied object \texttt{l$'$} is changed to: \texttt{l$'$ = [1]}.
The original object \texttt{l}  remains the same as it is not manipulated by the function.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{When reassigning in pass-by-value, only the copied list is changed}
\end{figure}

A similar thing happens in the \texttt{append} function, where after calling the function \texttt{l = [0]} and \texttt{l$'$ = [0, 1]}.
To visualise see \cref{parameter_value_l} and \cref{parameter_value_lprime}, here it becomes clear that when we access \texttt{l} after the call nothing has changed.

  \ppvs{l$'$}{[0, 1]}{The variable \texttt{l$'$} pointing at the list \texttt{[0, 1]} after calling function \texttt{append}}{parameter_value_lprime}
  \caption{When appending in pass-by-value, only the copied list is changed}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Pass-by-object-reference}
Pass-by-object-reference is the Python way of handling parameter passing.
In this parameter passing mechanism the argument is copied into a new variable local to the function, but both refer to the same object in memory.
Given the object \texttt{l = [0]} when calling the function \texttt{reassign}, a new variable \texttt{l$'$} is created that refers to the same \texttt{[0]} object in memory.
So \texttt{reassign} sets \texttt{l$'$ = [1]} but not \texttt{l} because \texttt{reassign} is not manipulating the object but only the name that is referring to it.
Calling \texttt{reassign} manipulates the variables and is visualised in \cref{parameter_object_reassign_l} and \cref{parameter_object_reassign_lprime}.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \ppvs{l$'$}{[1]}{The variable \texttt{l$'$} pointing at the list \texttt{[1]} after calling function \texttt{reassign}}{parameter_object_reassign_lprime}
  \caption{Pass-by-object-reference copies the variable, but points it at the same object as the original variable}
\end{figure}

When calling the \texttt{append} function the object is referenced and both \texttt{l} and \texttt{l$'$} are changed to \texttt{[0, 1]}.
Calling \texttt{append} manipulates the objects referenced by the variables.
This is visualised in \cref{parameter_object_append}.

  \node (result) at (3.5,4) {[0, 1]};
